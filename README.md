# awesome-budget

A simple Streamlit budgeting app with support for Nordigen open banking APIs.
Designed to be submitted as final CS50x project, once complete 

Note: This is very early in the development phase.
Despite having the potential to access real banking data,
THIS APP IS A STUDENT PROJECT. DESPITE MY BEST EFFORTS, I AM STILL LEARNING AND CANNOT GUARANTEE THE APP COMPLIES WITH SECURITY BEST PRACTICES - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Having said that, if you notice I'm doing something wrong or stupid, please open an issue - I'm keen to learn how to do it right!
